# Safepay SDK

## Overview

Safepay: Safepay is a regulated payments service provider that enables developers to orchestrate money movement between customers and businesses with ease and speed. The Safepay API makes it simple for businesses and financial platforms to create payment sessions, manage subscriptions, issue invoices and exchange value by sending and receiving money. Our API is based upon REST principles, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.

Safepay offers two environments to developers - `production` and `sandbox` . Any transaction performed in our `sandbox` environment will not have any financial impact. We also provide test credentials for payment instruments that can be used while integrating.

To begin integrating, we recommend you sign up for our sandbox account - its free to do so and will give you access to all of Safepay's APIs. Once you've completed your integration, please reach out to a member of our team who will guide you on how to create a production account and complete our onboarding process.
